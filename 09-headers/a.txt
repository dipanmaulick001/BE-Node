//Headers 

key-value pairs that are sent between client and server, which carries extra information such as metadata
about the req/response . 
Two types of headers : request headers and response headers 
Request headers : Sent by the client to the server during the request 
Response headers : Sent by the server to the client as a response 
common types of headers : authentication , content-type , referrer

eg of authentication headers: when we login google account , our dp is shown. How does the server know ?
the browser sends in authentication headers to the server along with the req.
content-type: json ( we write sometimes in postman)
So the thing is main data sent thru body
And extra data sent thru headers 
Most of the times, headers are snt by browsers ,by default, not by developers explicitly.
